Feature 2 - APplying to pfe 

this feature consists of he user basically uploading pfe books to our app (PDF) and then we use his global profile.md (or profile reprentation)with all his data and then scan the PFE book and make it into undividiaul "topics" of the pfe and preesent him with the topics and their numbered thata re fittingof his profile.
of course detect the email fothe compan yform the pfe book, and we give him th cards beautifuully with the actual sbjects, and their umber and why we think he's a good fit.
then the user can click it to apply automatically, we generate newCV that's optimizeed fo pfe subject and then a cover letter and then the eamil body, we then give him confirmatipon of cours eof the reusme, email cover letter etc and when confirmed he can click the send button.

of course eerything needs to be well abstracted so that theapp is very extensible and we can make the subjetc cards felxible to be used for jobs instead of pfe topics in the future.
